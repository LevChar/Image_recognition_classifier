# Image_recognition_classifier

This project identifies and paints circles given in RGB images. 
Specifically, each input image contains a rectangle, a triangle and a circle. 
The image is fed into a neural netork, whose outputs are the center and radius of the circle within the image. 
The domain considered is "[0,1]x[0,1] "box". 
PyTorch is the platform used. The goal is to paint the circle.
